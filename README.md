## Submitting a Website

In order to submit a web page you must adhere to the following process:

1. Check to see if the web page you are submitting has already been added
2. Use <a href="https://tools.pingdom.com">tools.pingdom.com</a> to get the proper page weight
3. Open a new PR:
    - Create a new file under the `_site_listings` directory
    - Name that file as `yourwebsitedomain.com.md` (see other listings for examples)
    - Edit the frontmatter data to reflect the new web page details
4. Submit the PR for review

### Review &amp; Accepting Submissions

**All web pages submitted will be manually reviewed for honesty and quality assurance.**

1MB Club has the final say whether a web page is added to the official listing or not. Spam, low-quality pages, or shady SEO gimmicks will not be tolerated. If your web page is not accepted, negative arguments or complaints will be ignored and deleted.

I look forward to seeing all your high quality, low-bandwidth web pages!
